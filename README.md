# Can I Fine-Tune Yet?

## Developing

Install dependencies with `npm install` and then start the local development
server with `npm start`.

### Testing

#### Visual (design) Testing

Ensure the storybook server is running, `npm run storybook`, which will be used
to capture screenshots of rendered components.

Then run `npm test` to run the desgin-matcher assertions.
